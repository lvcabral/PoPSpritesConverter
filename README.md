# Prince of Persia Sprites Converter

This tool was developed to convert graphical assets from the Prince of Persia 1 game (DOS version) into modern transparent Sprite Sheets 
and Maps. The idea was to have a tool that could convert Mods generated by the PoP modding community to my Roku version of the game.

The input for the tool is the files exported by the PR tool (see links below), that convert the original .dat files into a set of .bmp (images) and .pal (palette)  files.
The output is a set of individual frames organized in folders and the sprite sheets with its correspondent .json maps.

**Usage:**
```
popsc <PR resources path> <sprites output path> [-pwm=<palace marks mode>]

Optional parameter:
0 : Change palace wall marks palette to the 15th color of wall.pal (default)
1 : Keep palace wall marks pallete from the bmp files
2 : Special palace wall marks configuration for SNES Mods
``` 

This tool requires Microsoft .Net Framework 4.5 and incorporates code from the SpriteSheetPacker project (link below).
